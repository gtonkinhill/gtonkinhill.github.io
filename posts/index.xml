      <description>Shut up Spotify! Apart from when I&amp;rsquo;m forced to work from home I have generally worked in open plan offices. One of my big fears each day is that I will open my laptop and whatever embarrassing song I was listening to will immediately start playing on full volume for everyone to hear.
Recently I bought a new pair of bluetooth headphones that conveniently allow you to connect to multiple devices at once.</description>

      <description>How many gene annotations are there? Grace Blackwell recently gave a really interesting talk on her work  Blackwell, G. A. et al. Exploring bacterial diversity via a curated and searchable snapshot of archived DNA sequences. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 2021.03.02.433662 (2021) doi:10.1101/2021.03.02.433662 generating a standardised and curated database of 661,405 bacterial genome assemblies using read data retrieved from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).
This dataset is already proving to be very useful.</description>
